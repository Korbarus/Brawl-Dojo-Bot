# Brawl Dojo Bot
This is a bot to provide access to the data within the Brawl Dojo spreadsheet. This should keep track of particular mentors, etc.

Additionally, this bot helps the Brawl Dojo discord server to verify if users have 50 hours or more on the game, "Brawlhalla". If they have, then they'll be given a Mentee role which allows them to see content aimed towards tutoring the mentee on the game's mechanics.

This bot also acts as a way to simplify administrative tasks, such as assigning users as mentors to users who have registered interest in mentoring. By calling simple commands, this bot returns clean and succinct messages to introduce the mentors to their mentees and vice versa.

Additionally, this takes information from a Google Sheet that tracks the in game rankings of the mentors. With the correct command, you can show the rankings of all mentors of a certain region, a certain weapon type or both.

This bot is currently under development and as such some functionality is limited.
